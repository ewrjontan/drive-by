## Description

This was created using Bootstrap as a portfolio project for my Nucamp bootcamp. 

Currently in progress however, I will most likely cease working on this and rebuild using React for more functionality.


## Usage

Meant to be used to source photographers based on location. Currently, Mapbox-GL is used for acquiring the client location. 


## Dependencies

    "@fortawesome/fontawesome-free": "^5.15.2",
    "bootstrap": "^4.5.2",
    "jquery": "^3.5.1",
    "mapbox-gl": "^2.1.1",
    "popper.js": "^1.16.1"
 

## Roadmap

Future updates include:
* Will be rebuilding this project with React.js and MongoDB
* A React Native mobile version is planned as well. 
* Need to finish adding functionality for account/user settings and options
